I have a class at 1:30 How old are you? Ha ha ha ha go like that me in 15 minutes possible .. Hyung, I have something to do before class. I don't think I can eat it. Sorry OK right in front that last year Too bad I didn't buy it It's okay because it's new I'm thinking about whether to live Actually, you have to wear it to know emoticon I'm too tired to go to the gym... Let's go haha Is today holiday? I overslept today Have you tried it about one size I think you should buy a big one I 110 salagon No but let's buy it I guess I won't be able to wear it for a few months. the experiment 2 Are you talking?? If you combine these two equations, the theoretical value the same value loop1 and 2 to r2 Because the direction is opposite The signs seem to be reversed I think... I see up to 3 kids he loosened up just asking Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .. brother's school? I should I have a class at 1:30 How long do you have class go together? that ,, about 1 hour 15 minutes Can you wait..? no, at that 1:30 I think I will go haha.. emoticon OK Did you do the dinon assignment?? I'm blocked from the 2nd time... at 3 times a Find the 2's complement of two numbers Photo What happens when you subtract 1 from 0? Isn't that how you solve it?? ah I knew right away thank you brother already done Ohh did you eat Photo and this When I add it, I have 1 left on top. What should I do,, Wrong then Is not it as a 6-bit binary number then what is number 2 He's just talking about finding an 8-bit binary number 2's complement It's a problem to save Let's eat rice... when I slowly can i go out Hmm I'll get one It's okay I haven't tried it here ricotta that's the building I don't understand number 5 Help why is it there I don't know, emoticon Did you finish eating... ? Brother Dinon Project The friend I met in the middle of the road the other day Let's do it together What do you think lol He has one friend four people together hahahaha Nice i'm experimenting school now??? OK emoticon I picked a new one I feel good emoticon I also have Omphang. lol where is my girlfriend... what's the class Ha ha ha ha ha ha see you tomorrow morning squat 10 degrees at 60 It's hard... too weak lol 10 6 4 like this... Are you loosening up? on this day has exist on chicken breast Hetbahn.. best dinner report only have to start paying No. 3 strlen strtok like this No matter how hard I try, I can't Doing it 4 times... I can't believe that up to four traces of number 4 come out. I can't That's a problem... LOL I'm going to exercise today... 5 hours left cheetah run emoticon I can't solve it 3 or 4 times, but I'll try to solve it not yet I have to go with the mindset of giving flesh and taking bones.. Can I submit more?? lol 12 hours have it 10 percent It's a deduction I saw it earlier suddenly invisible what Eulmaena Eulmaena okay lol than gimbap country It's cheap lol muchin it must be delicious How long is the class I see what are you doing Haha I was going to ask hyung about that. I feel so sorry for Yu-Wan.. I don't know how to roll it Hyung Ham?? Ha ha ha ha happy campus that Not hard to solve?? lol Photo out of mind I think I'm leaving lol Is it particularly hot today? Originally, I couldn't have been like this, but at this time rather great messed up haha Did you buy an Imti? What do you think File: Dinon test.zip gift with the most expensive lol Just kidding, buy me coffee haha Obvious seniors, obvious juniors Didn't you apply?? what I got it wrong Joe is out no Don't press submit after writing Is it or not? emoticon check several times I wouldn't have missed it long time ago From what I remember from the lecture I think he said he only saw the finale. code is long Ah, I'll send it via KakaoTalk #include <iostream> m>  std;

The current flowing through R1 is V1/R1 The current flowing through R2 is P1-F/R Like this confusion uh maybe will be right ㅇㅇㅇ Right  Happy birthday..! emoticon hahahahahahahaha hehe I don't like to study hahahahaha 71 I'm talking goof I'm screwed too ^*^ bro, this is the experimental value what came out 1 parking ..
