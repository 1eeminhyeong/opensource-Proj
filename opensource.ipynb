I have a class at 1:30 How old are you? Ha ha ha ha go like that me in 15 minutes possible .. Hyung, I have something to do before class. I don't think I can eat it. Sorry OK right in front that last year Too bad I didn't buy it It's okay because it's new I'm thinking about whether to live Actually, you have to wear it to know emoticon I'm too tired to go to the gym... Let's go haha Is today holiday? I overslept today Have you tried it about one size You should buy a big one I 110 salagon No but let's buy it I guess I won't be able to wear it for a few months. the experiment 2 Are you talking?? If you combine these two equations, the theoretical value the same value loop1 and 2 to r2 Because the direction is opposite The signs seem to be reversed I think... I see up to 3 kids he loosened up just asking Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .. brother's school? I should I have a class at 1:30 How long do you have class go together? that ,, about 1 hour 15 minutes Can you wait..? no, at that 1:30 I think I'll go haha.. emoticon OK Did you do the dinon assignment?? I'm blocked from the 2nd time... at 3 times a Find the 2's complement of two numbers Photo What happens when you subtract 1 from 0? Isn't that how you solve it?? ah I knew right away thank you brother already done Ohh did you eat Photo and this When I add it, I have 1 left on top. What should I do,, Wrong then Is not it as a 6-bit binary number then what is number 2 He's just talking about finding an 8-bit binary number 2's complement It's a problem to save Let's eat rice... when I slowly can i go out Hmm I'll get one It's okay I haven't tried it here ricotta that's the building I don't understand number 5 help why is it there I don't know, emoticon Did you finish eating... ? Brother Dinon Project The friend I met in the middle of the road the other day Let's do it together What do you think lol He has one friend four people together hahahaha Nice i'm experimenting school now??? OK emoticon I picked a new one I feel good emoticon I also have Omphang. lol where is my girlfriend... what's the class Ha ha ha ha ha ha see you tomorrow morning squat 10 degrees at 60 It's hard... too weak lol 10 6 4 like this... Are you loosening up? on this day has exist on chicken breast Hetbahn.. best dinner report only have to start paying No. 3 strlen strtok like this No matter how hard I try, I can't Doing it 4 times... I can't believe that up to four traces of number 4 come out. I can't That's a problem... LOL I'm going to exercise today... 5 hours left cheetah run emoticon I can't solve it 3 or 4 times, but I'll try to solve it not yet I have to go with the mindset of giving flesh and taking bones.. Can I submit more?? lol 12 hours have it 10 percent It's a deduction I saw it earlier suddenly invisible what Eulmaena Eulmaena Okay lol than gimbap country It's cheap lol muchin it must be delicious How long is the class I see what are you doing ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I was going to ask him about that. I feel so sorry for Yu-Wan.. I don't know how to roll it Hyung Ham?? Ha ha ha ha happy campus that Not hard to solve?? lol Photo out of mind I think I'm leaving lol Is it particularly hot today? Originally, it wasn't like this, but at this time rather great messed up haha Did you buy an Imti? What do you think File: Dinon test.zip gift with the most expensive lol Just kidding, buy me coffee haha Obvious senior, obvious junior Didn't you apply?? what I got it wrong Joe is out no Don't press submit after writing Is it or not? emoticon check several times I wouldn't have missed it long time ago From what I remember from the lecture I think he said he only saw the finale. code is long Ah, I'll send it via KakaoTalk #include <iostream> m>  std;

Just in question V1, V2 I asked LOL Voltage takes on R1 no electric current to R3,R2,R1 flowing current I know everything circuit theory outside of hearing hehe so V1 is to base node about It's the voltage you got The reference node is probably bottom row voltage as reference node would have caught V1-Vreference to find I set the reference voltage to 0. The current flowing through R1 is V1/R1 The current flowing through R2 is P1-F/R Like this confusion uh maybe will be right ㅇㅇㅇㅇ Right  Happy birthday..! emoticon hahahahahahahaha hehe I don't like to study hahahahaha 71 I'm talking goof I'm screwed too ^*^ bro, this is the experimental value what came out 1 parking ..

Is it really long? Why did you make the bigger one instead of combining it? so It does not add p q r delay. Why is the logic gate with the longest delay tpd? I don't remember very well... Oh draw? Then tpd = 2.5+4+3.5 Is it Maybe 5 times and 8 times is it possible,,,, frequency max Are you looking for Ah tpd?? As if right emoticon but at number 8 Are you using 500Mhz? send ah ok understood thank you I don't think it's anything else I solved all but a few problems.

I'm going for an assignment sitpal Oh Junnae Oh Bande Is it possible to print it without using it yourself? sitpal In fact, I haven't even written a single assignment yet. Doing goof like a dog 4 times Surprisingly, I didn't use tail I guess it was like this I'll turn on my laptop and After that wail door just sleep but why are you running? Is not it I did too then I can't do it on my phone that the departure station received as an argument using strcmp If it's right, you can't stop Then you don't have to decide where to turn.

Then, while moving from the start station to the destination station with next, the number of next moves is increased When it arrives, replace the current node with the starting temp temp you saved earlier. yes move back to the starting point with a shorter one e = head; //number of stops passed (when going to the right) //Number of stops to go left  from != tail) { (currNode->station, st1) == 0) { e = currNode;   currNode->next;  de != tail) { // when turning right (currNode->station, st2) == 0) {    currNode->next;  mpNode; de != tail) { // when turning left (currNode->station, st2) == 0) {    currNode->prev;  pronunciation) e;  with;  After that first wild door, currNode is not the departure station. ah That's right It's an ignorant copy of the Dynon assignment, but can you help me?

I need to set breakpoints and debug. fell asleep Why is the output like that? I'll see if the output isn't pretty. should i go minhyeong It's the 14th week of the computer room Why are we still not uploading lecture materials and preliminary reports for class tomorrow? No, it's tomorrow Isn't it too much I slept so far, so now I have to do it again. It's so much fun hahahaha the end is in sight sparkle By the way, the computer room preliminary report assignment I haven't come up yet Is it possible not to? No, just a node or a tree ah it's not a tree link why are you again that's right After all, it's a computer room for class 1. It is said that the preliminary report assignment has not been uploaded... What is Min Hyung? ㅇㅇ At 12:30, there is a seondae zoom I don't want to go home because there's a snack event. rice?

I heard about the project I got angry Checking the delivery of the keyboard Still on the plane to Korea After getting angry again, I fall asleep and run away I'll be back soon when I come back to Korea What space station did you go to? Guide me from the sky It seems like a long day Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Isn't it the full output of command 3? make that first Put it in then print it out kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Me too Failed to subtract part-time job for both sitpal and toil only saturday It was hard as it is I made one Create a two-dimensional array first Insert tree while exploring to the curl node printed while exploring ji while turning the curl node Can't you just print it out?

Oh, why would it suck if I put it in and delete it? iced coffee does that not work? don't you stop? When I debug, it just exits. take a look lol I can't fix it ㅇ come down now But, I've done everything, so it'll be fine. Didn't you say there was no next class then? Hyungah Min If you don't sleep with your roommate anyway come on disco You can't do it as an object lol Photo why is this 5 Oh, no matter how much I count, I almost came out with 10 Oh, but I did it with my assistant and my assistant during class. Why did you say 5? ? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha So I did it with my assistant I know the bill when I get home, so 10v comes out Replying to @DragonBall I used that when solving problem 1 and solved it. Isn't number 2 just making Thevenin? Wow... Rth is 100 right Parallel merge, serial merge, parallel merge from the left Oh, you're right, I wrote it wrong. sitpal No, if you do the calculation again, you get 1. Because it says 0.1. Oh I still don't know why the Voc is 5 I have to pay for it once; So... The circuit theory part is the only one in the computer lab. I tried to do this perfectly.] No answer lol I made a turn!! There are points worth noting I can't free the memory... Are you tired too?? I heard that Hyemi noona was also out, so there was an uproar If I go back, I'll take it too. sitpal Didn't we all do it together for the 3rd? You ask and let me know. under.. I'm in the 14th week of the computer room. Is the answer to number 2 correct? ??? No, why are you doing the laundry during the exam period? Crazy guy haha Mmmmmmm I hope there are no bean sprouts in the laundry. woah.. Bean sprouts bags are expensive. Rth is there in experiment 2 Wh.. sorry sitpal So if you multiply that by the voltage 5 is right Is not it ah The assistant has released; Oh I don't know if this is right Hyeongminah you but aside from that fsm Can the counter draw up to the circuit?? phew.. thank god Actually, I solve it by looking back on what I did with my assistant. Junnae suffers because he keeps not coming out this sitpal lower part With only 3 codes Are you ignoring 10?? on those two pages under Oh is it like that? by the way traffic light in dinon made with that long stick Why did you make it a flip flop here? stick?? we don't learn at all Isn't that what the assistant pays for? me too.. No, the counter is fucking It’s okay until the next state from there to Carno How are you looking for a logical line?;; Photo no, last time I know I just saw it But what is he Ae-im in the 6th week More similar counters in Week 7 I can't sleep because I don't know these two okay.. me too I was going to hit it now look Is it right One Q Photo by writing I'm doing a Karnaugh map. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ㅇㅇ Lastly, counter. trim I have to wake up at 8:30 Oh my gosh what the heck I look like a pair of hot pants?!?! kkkkkkkkkk If you tell me to draw it, I will just not draw it. I understand the next state, state line, result table, etc. don't draw circuits I had to get up at 7:30 Siftal tightened saved that yep But if you add Isn't he IL? hehe go to sleep I can sleep for three and a half hours rice after? When you wake up, the writing point thank you why are there so many Shit, the manager can come 30 minutes earlier tomorrow. If you're not going to give me a part-time job, please let me sleep at least. I want to sleep Shizaru lying down to sleep... why what is it lol But the horizontal connection Isn't it time to make a two-dimensional? back and forth?? Is it a function that makes it back and forth? That's right like you did 4 times send me that code that part g> m> std;              char[50]; v = up = down = left = right = back = forth = nullptr;   ord;   whoList {    List() { lptr;  ansverse(Node* node) { //vertical connection Node = node; t = 0; = 0; i < 3; i++) { e == nullptr) { * newNode = new Node; et(newNode->word, '\\0', 50); Node = newNode; = newNode;   * newNode = new Node; et(newNode->word, '\\0', 50); Node->next = newNode; ode->prev = currNode; unt++;    rtical(Node* node) { // Specify head in horizontal connection...? Node = node; = 0; i < 3.; i++) { e == nullptr) { * newNode = new Node; et(newNode->word, '\\0', 50); Node = newNode; = newNode;   * newNode = new Node; Node->down = newNode; ode->up = currNode;    cktoFront(Node* node) { //connect top and bottom Node = node; = 0; i < 3; i++) { e == nullptr) { * newNode = new Node; et(newNode->word, '\\0', 50); Node = newNode; = newNode;   * newNode = new Node; ->back = newNode; ode->forth = node;    be() { Node = head; = 0; = 0; i < 3; i++) { //horizontal concatenation tj = 0; d < 3; j++) { edTransverse(currNode); Node = currNode->down;  ; e = head; t i = 0; i < count; i++) currNode = currNode->back;  head;  = 0; i < 3; i++) { //vertical concatenation tj = 0; d < 3; j++) { edVertical(currNode); Node = currNode->next;  ; e = head; t i = 0; i < count; i++) currNode = currNode->back;  head;  = 0; i < 3; i++) { //Concatenate back and forth t j = 0; j < 3; i++) { edBacktoFront(currNode); Node = currNode->next;  ; e = head; t i = 0; i < count; i++) currNode = currNode->down;       List List; be();      Because I have to put the coordinates anyway to the new node while initializing words just put the coordinates The problem Is that a function called vertical connect? isn't it you? Head is null in the first place But then To go down after function what should be below Ah, can I keep putting you in? newly made It seems like it can't connect? Cull node keeps saying you? connected to nadung while pressing F11 whether it goes in properly I guess I'll just have to see if it turns out to be you Oh, it seems that the node received as a factor is always null, so it seems I did a new node sitpal Turn off the computer so I can't debug. Wake up at 9.. sleep.. I need to sleep.. Going back to work tomorrow... ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ you go to work tomorrow Yes part-time job again Envy you.. What can I teach you? Let's go to math science class ㅇㅇ They say I’m going to play OTT with my disco At night was it 9 o'clock I'm on my way to a part-time job like a dog... Wah..? Sipal..? it's no use...

I was forced to do it twice in the first period. I have to choose after today kkkkkkkkkkkk where to go on vacation Nope Gapyeong Gapyeong is good, take me too Wow have a good trip ^^ Now, from next week, I only go out for 2 days ends at the end of the day I tried to run away, but the manager caught me. ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ When are you quitting? kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Are you only going to take 15 credits? If you know, I did it kkkkkkkkk Easy to use internet I thought it would be hard even if I only took 15 credits. worried But this professor has no meaning hahahaha Com Kisil and Degusil are the same no matter who listens to them There is only one open source and Dinon 2 Oh, everyone is one I just have to look at the time and choose it hahahaha Now that it's all face-to-face, did you only take charge of one professor? Is that so kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk I was wondering if I should listen to this in advance Doesn't seem to be open this semester; Actually, there are lessons I wanted to hear. If you do that, it's 3 1st period Over pants at 2-2? ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ 3 days 1 class.. it's called illustration There is honey education in drawing The sitpal is too good kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk emoticon That's true, but Professor Junnae is famous for being kind and giving good grades. Since it is small, it is absolutely evaluated and it is difficult to register for courses hahahahahaha ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ When are you listening to degusil and computer room? let's listen together Are the assignments okay? They both give you homework every week. experience It is beneficial to postpone the assignment Since classes start on Thursday, one must be done on Wednesday. admit? After all, the degusil and computer room are all done by assistants haha I can't even see the professor's face! Only those who have heard of it know Siftal is real Aren't they all doing the same thing? ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ it's a bug It is possible if it is promoted kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk It's the same as my thoughts right above it Believe it or not, why is it so trustworthy? Can't they both dodge the ball?? Perfect for a computer room on Monday dodge the ball and look; Both of them are the same mustard and the time is symmetrical cancer or hear what you hear Doesn't that matter because it's cultured? I'll have to listen to it with the newbies next semester kkkkkkkkk Wow, how do you know what to eat hwangol again haha Thank you. Have a good meal. Jiwon hyung told me to listen to this I'll ask later Are you going to listen to discrete mathematics? uh what Discrete Mathematics Is this an algorithm related class? I thought it was something like airborne I'm suddenly interested Ah, there are only classes for withdrawal..? Algorithms are a required subject in Computer Science. Photo Is this correct? ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ Application for admission is easy Subjects with only one class, such as discrete or open source Will there be as many seats as possible unconditionally? uhh... 6 majors, 1st class hahahahahahahahaha I'm really dizzy already I thought it was harder than the first semester yep I thought it was fine without cancer. You go on a trip then hahahaha I'm drinking, but I have to take the subway 10 o'clock study still working Oh my Hyeongminah I am hungry Confirm kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk But if correction fails Wouldn't it be nice to include it even if it's unique? kill me... come in For an hour and a half from 10:30, review while asking questions I hate dogs no what is that about?

We have to change our subject. Because the internet is all over It's so complete hahahaha If it's moderate, I'll make a difference. To be honest? If I was doing it alone, I would grit my teeth and pretend I didn't know Because Junnae did it again I feel like I'm wasting time. I don't care Oh right;; have to do that is it true Well, write a short thesis instead. M2 MacBook Air Goes I'm going to go bald while worrying Siftal, are you leaving now? ?!?!?!

But just write the name and put it in the file I said ㅇㅇ Let's go I have a lot of data haha on the test bench Didn't I set the vector size wrong? 19:0 or so  Tell the front how many beats you're going to receive It says how many vector arrays are behind. If you do that, there are 10000 4-bit vectors ddd yep magic Molu, did I change too? But I'm just reading It doesn't matter since you declared Something like c_expected should be declared as 1 bit I forgot the opcode when inserting the vector at the rising edge On 값 The one after the a and b When adding vector values {a,b,op,result… Do it like this and put in the OP It's different the error is just the code It is because the expected value and the calculated value are configured differently. The waveform has a problem with the real code.,, After that falling edge no begin? Eh Once the termination condition Change it to 19 instead of 4 and run the simulation again waveform press the black magnifying glass show me everything All values ​​are not entered I don't know if the change is too fast or not. Why is reset still 0 again? on Negedge Begin end, try putting it on' ah right Sifal sigh One result wasn't right. Was it because Y was in front? I guess fixing that was the end. Do you return the teke the way it was originally made instead of that way? scraped from lecture material If you do that, you'll know if the circuit is correct. Hmm.. Then the code is a problem haha Five? zzz Nice~ yes Why did that hyung come all the way here hahahaha If you finish the computer room today Rawmust read It's like this because it's Linux It doesn't seem to be as difficult as it was in Cube. Yami~ thank you bridge I wrote it in binary kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Who doesn't know that lol  Carry is what goes after the most significant bit. Overflow is when the value exceeds the value that can be expressed. For example But only overflow occurs I think I did it in just the addition operation When carry occurs on the most significant bit, the carry is Overflow occurs if carry occurs only in the next-order bit Well.. But I guess that's right that's what i think Anyway, both addition and subtraction occur in the adder. Only the sign of the argument changes Wasn't that handled in mx2? So both are going to be the same I'm going to cut now... 1st period tomorrow Hey Hyungmin Photo If you increase the original brightness, Does it come out like a little bit broken? tell me soon lol sitpal Photo No, if it's ike, you're adjusting the brightness, right? I know middle ah I know what it feels like thank you After coming home and sleeping for just 30 minutes, my mind clears up Oh, it's still dark Because it's originally bright I guess it's over the max. done all creation  I know how to average one. Junnae Ohbaim, how did you approach that? No, that's what I'm trying to do don't say I'll try more Oh, it seems like a burden Photo No, I made it up It stops at the line I chose under..

creation tree.. I have 12 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha The little things you sent me are all done Damn because it was originally a market file dingIndexTable(); nt, string>> ordered_item;  ered item = item_array.begin(); iter != item_array.end(); iter++) { le->find_frequency(*iter); n handling when item does not exist in indexTable or value is less than threshold 0) continue; mp < threshold) continue;  _item.push_back(make_pair(temp, *iter));   item.begin(), ordered_item.end(), compare);  i<ordered_item.size(); i++) { dered_item[i].first << \" \" << ordered_item[i].second << '\\n';  << endl;  oot; i<ordered_item.size(); i++) { hildrenNode(ordered_item[i].second) != nullptr) { getChildrenNode(ordered_item[i].second); teFrequency(1); e;   t in children managed by map class New = new FPNode; dateFrequency(1); tParent(p); children(ordered_item[i].second, New); Node(table, ordered item[i].second, New); //Connect New node getChildrenNode(ordered_item[i].second);         //Update FPNode p, p indicate parent e;    what is comparator?? sort(ordered_item.begin(), ordered_item.end(), compare); this You mean ascending ordered_item? thank you Anjaya it's gone now i have to start again Joan wanted to go quickly. I was held up until 10. Use the create tree multiple times 20 times? I market text reading it again Abandon Threshold Did you put it in sorted? how did you put it i did this tree output is different from yours But no matter what I think, there's nothing wrong So pissed off while debugging I drew all the fptrees in theory. Then the tree output is correct Is the shape of the tree different if the method of insertion is different? no It prints fine to my tree. I look different from you Photo looks like this ㅇㅇ I'm crazy trida pictures Hey hold on, hang up a disco Let's just solve this Is it difficult to get Biffy Tree? are you alive I'm not going to school tomorrow so I'll do it on the weekend are you dead are you dead did you live If you split a non-root Oh don't explain this Of course, the insert index points to pDataNode Shouldn't the original index point to the left node that came off? Can I not code this separately? Is not it Oh I'm going to die No, how can you do something that has already been done? Is value updated? What's new? ah;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ah no so by the way we are while splitting the data the data pointed to by the original index You have to replace it with the left node you cut off. Otherwise, it is originally pDataNode If you give the left node to the original key as the value is there an update There is a node pointing to the data index. can't you just do that As far as I know the map is map[key]+=a;    Therefore, you can handle it as you would normally change a variable. If you write like this value is modified? If you traverse with an iterator this is shubam Even if I go back well made I need to confirm I can't go to the next step because I can't confirm; I haven't made an index split yet; Once you've done this, print it out and check it out. I need to find out where I went wrong between the two inserts and splits hahaha It seems to have entered in the order of 23465 Oh then? really like lot bp tree Ah, my head really hurts so I just asked haha no shit Data split aside the index is doesn't exist It's just that the print doesn't have an index split When the tree is created, the root is 4,5 hahahahahahaha yep we then on the insert equal sign that's when Because of that, I was fucking a high school student That's why I'm bored all day.. admit.. When 2 eggs are entered Among the index nodes that are greater than 2, is it correct to go in and output a pattern that includes an egg? I didn't find it in the index node, I just searched from the left most left child to Next lol There is no way to check how it was printed. void BpTree::printFrequentPatterns(set<string> pFrequentPattern, string item did you use this friend Writing to bptree output? No, but why delete the item and print it out; because i erased it n why? I'm bored.. I thought it would have gone well with Next Priv, so I removed it and checked it. Just in case, I wonder if Next Freev is not working well;; so to output Seeing that it came out only in distant 2 and 6 middle is not connected yep huh? Cutting to the left is a distant sound Divide 21 31? oh i did that If the prib of pDatanode is not null I gave it a condition... yep the original guy he was originally Shouldn't it have been pointing to pDataNode's prev Is not it oh why not Oh, it's not that I didn't connect I think I connected it wrong when I split it later When you first split it, 2 and 3,4 are connected? solved after connecting well Weirdly it was reconnecting; Hey Hyungmin, are you alive? You can change it Is it Compedance? ah? I haven't tried the second one. I guess you can just look at it? no mega? Hmm ostLeftChild()) { MostLeftChild();   ter = p->getDataMap()->begin(); iter != p->getDataMap()->end(); iter++) { < \"Key : \" << iter->first << endl; tPatternNode* temp = iter->second; st auto& elem : temp->getList()) { string> s = elem.second; t << elem.first << \" \"; const auto& elem2 : s) { error << elem2 << \" \";  t << endl;   Next();    It was a billion dogs Hyeongminah Why does this print confidence have 3 parameters? Isn't it enough to have two? Oh I realized' I didn't do anything but it didn't change If you find it, you don't just have to connect that part in the code are you alive ㅇㅇ It is related The proposal included egg milk energybar cola papper chicken. going in If we have the same frequency, the order is different Remember going to milk egg energybar pepper cola chicken? At that time, that noona told the assistant that no water was available. Because it's a, that's right But then If you create an fptree in the low state The shape of the tree is different from the proposal It's disgusting Shall I ask the collar? More results appear With a tree picture I drew before It's not wrong if you follow along Doesn't seem too difficult I didn't use singlepath I don't know how to write that This is a subset function. Oh right I have to go now to see are you going brother min ah 5 4 3 2 1 ㅗㅗㅗ Hey hey hey oh memory leak you check it out Hyeongminah gone , paradise Hyungah Min if you go to the election Do you do the head of the line? If you have any questions or concerns, Jiwon will ask or deliver to you and help you publicize the election. You can tell support hyung what I ask you to do. payment ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ Do you have a fraudulent contract? as it was I have already received the preliminary candidate form I need to get signed and ready. Ji-Won said that the form was delivered to Ji-Won hyung because he didn’t do his college work. That's why it's not a big deal Yaya It's my sister's birthday on Saturday. Cake with Yuri tomorrow? Just in time for our class to end Oh and I solved infinite loading No matter how much I think about it, something is strange, so I thought about it from the beginning I have 1500 lines of data. I set the threshold to 2 and solve it. damn So if it's 300 million lines At least 5 words per line Tteing tsk I will eat it and leave it okay Oh, extra points? You don't have to make a new one I'm leaking memory, but I paid it just; 4 is too difficult kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk I understood the principle, but the implementation is a mess ten hahahahahahaha Beep and then I do not know.. you asr and csr how did you make it Oh yeah? Sipal.. Is it a plus that I said I shouldn't use it? I was driving... FYI, I might scratch my heart Ha ha ha Oh, I'm jealous I'm on a 5 hour apnea assignment Bucheon Park Tae-hwan Ernie no cla I can just add hahahahaha I didn't say anything, so I'll just say + Should I pay this and eat soup today? Are you sleeping? Yaya what are you doing the glass I'll send you a picture of my visit kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk It's not even a death threat. kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk They say they want to roll We always lose, but do we always have fun? Hyungmin, where are you? Yaya Hyungmin Photo what did i do wrong No matter what I do, that simple code shows a syntax error. Really? Should I not use it? Wow damn it's real Oh, just what is so much When are all the projects\n",

The main character's father fell If you're going to stay under me, I'll keep you as manager. But out of the five attributes, I came out thinking that only the heroine's father would be chosen. So now even the permanent residence is in jeopardy the main character's father I'm setting up a new manager for air properties The lord's family is the lord's family. The two now have a power struggle. So now, to some extent, the main character's father A reason to take revenge? If there is, there is so i covered it up yes and now You did a purge of Yeoju's family. Finally, Yeoju's grandmother took Yeoju and ran outside the manor.
